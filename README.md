# collab-learning

This project presents a collaborative learning solution designed as a unique platform focused on enhancing real-time student collaboration. It solves the problem of fragmented teamwork caused by the use of multiple disconnected tools for communication, file sharing, AI assistance, and coding.

Existing platforms offer these features separately, which reduces efficiency and collaboration. This platform improves upon them by enabling group-based chat, video communication, shared resources, real-time file editing, AI-assisted learning, and collaborative coding in one place. Users can work together simultaneously on files and code while interacting through integrated communication tools.
